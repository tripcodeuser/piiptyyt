TODO list for piiptyyt:

  - GCache's eviction policy is far too eager. There should instead be a cache
	data structure that uses some kind of low/high watermark basis for
	replacement, and pushes items to the release function in groups so that it
	can do a big transaction rather than one transaction per item.
	[v2] Asynchronous replacement could also be on the cards.
